Pac-Man is my project on taking the popular gaming icon "Pac-Man" and making him move across the screen.
Skills used in this project:
 - Detecting the edge of the screen using the x and y axis.
 - Flipping the images around when reaching a certain point.
 - Setting interval rules to have Pac-Man run on his own.
