# PacMan
Pac-Man is my project on taking the popular gaming icon "Pac-Man" and making him move across the screen.

Skills used in this project:
 - Detecting the edge of the screen using the x and y axis.
 - Flipping the images around when reaching a certain point.
 - Setting interval rules to have Pac-Man run on his own.
 
## How to Run
1. Clone the Repository. 
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.
3. Click the Add PacMan button, and then Start Game.

## Roadmap to Future Installments
I would like to see future iterations with Ms.PacMan, and possible control of Ms. PacMan with the arrow keys or your mouse.
