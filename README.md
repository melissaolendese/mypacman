Pac-Man is my project on taking the popular gaming icon "Pac-Man" and making him move across the screen.

Skills used in this project:
 - Detecting the edge of the screen using the x and y axis.
 - Flipping the images around when reaching a certain point.
 - Setting interval rules to have Pac-Man run on his own.

 Eye Exercise is a project that allows a set of eyes to follow your cusor movement.  This was a great coding assignment that allowed me to practice different CSS stylings and coding cusor movement for the first time!
## How to Run
Simply follow my link to open up the HTML file to watch those eyes follow you around.
## Roadmap to Future Installments
I would love to hear any suggestions on what the next iteration of this could look like!  We could change colors, cusor icons, or change the styles of the eyes as well.  I'd love to hear suggestions on what you think the next steps could look like.
